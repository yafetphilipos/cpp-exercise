# Group Assignment - C++ Programming

## Project Overview
This project contains solutions to multiple programming problems implemented in C++ as part of a group assignment. Each section covers specific programming concepts such as matrix manipulation, dynamic memory allocation, sorting using function pointers, and object-oriented programming principles.

---

## Features
1. **Matrix Multiplication** - Demonstrates matrix input, validation, and multiplication with error handling.
2. **Dynamic Memory Allocation** - Allocates memory dynamically for an integer array and computes sum and average.
3. **Sorting with Function Pointers** - Uses function pointers for sorting arrays in ascending or descending order.
4. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** - Examples of constructors, destructors, default constructors, and constructor overloading.

---

## Menu System
The program features an interactive menu that allows users to:
1. Choose and execute any program from the list.
2. Validate inputs to ensure proper data handling.
3. Exit the program safely.

---

## Menu Options
```
1. Matrix Multiplication
2. Dynamic Memory Allocation
3. Function Pointers for Sorting
4. Constructor Example
5. Destructor Example
6. Default Constructor Example
7. Constructor Overloading Example
8. Exit
```
Users can select an option by entering the corresponding number.

## Prerequisites
- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++, MinGW, or Visual Studio Code with extensions)
- Basic understanding of C++ programming concepts.

---

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
   ```
   g++ main.cpp -o main
   ```
4. Execute the program:
   ```
   ./main
   ```
